# CausalGeneAnalysis
This repository contains analysis and exploration of causal and non-causal relationships between genes and phenotypes using embeddings generated from GPT-3.5. The project applies vector analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN) to uncover potential patterns and insights into causality.
